# Fynelium for [Bazzite Linux](https://bazzite.gg/)

## Installation

1. Backup ALL your data on the disk
2. Get the [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/#image-picker) GNOME image for your hardware, without Steam Gaming mode
3. Get [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/latest), open it and use a spare USB drive for it
4. Move that file, ending with ".iso" to "Ventoy" partition of the USB Drive with Ventoy installed.
5. Reboot your device, and boot into the USB drive
6. In the Bazzite installer,
Choose to wipe out your entire system disk, avoid LUKS encryption if you prefer to start your system in an unattended way
8. After getting to the desktop, run this script in "Terminal"

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-LX/refs/heads/main/script/main.fish" | fish

```

Seeing errors is normal. Allow inhibiting shortcuts if requested.

Sometimes your user password will be asked. Copy and paste it whenever prompted.
In terminals, usually it is Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V for copy-pasting

You may not like some preferences so ðŸª¨ âž› ðŸ—¿ as you like only after the reboot,
as doing so during the script runs can result in errors ðŸ¤¯

What to do with the drive? Keep it as a backup troubleshooting drive!
You can move ISOs like UBCD Live, HBCD, or even Tails if ykyk
