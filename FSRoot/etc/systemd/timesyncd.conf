# Having a well thought out range of poll interval limits is usually a lot more efficient than blindly inserting a large range
# On a new installations, it is frequent but not as much as systemd's default of 32 seconds
# Adapts to the hardware clock over time for balanced efficiency and accuracy

# 5 mins of save interval is fine 
# Assume modern device keep time accurate for atleast 20 minutes
