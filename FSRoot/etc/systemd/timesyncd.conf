# Having a well thought out range of poll interval limits is usually a lot more efficient than blindly inserting a large range
# On a new installations, it is frequent at first
# But soon adapts to the hardware clock as time passes for balanced energy efficiency and accuracy

# 5 mins of save interval is fine
# No device can be so cheap to not keep time accurate for atleast 20 minutes
