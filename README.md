## Installation

1. Get the [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/#image-picker) GNOME image for your hardware, without Steam Gaming mode \
2. Get [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/latest), open it and use a spare USB drive for it \
3. Move that file, ending with ".iso" to "Ventoy" partition of the USB Drive with Ventoy installed \
4. Reboot your device, and boot into the USB drive choosing the Bazzite installer \
5. You may wipe your system disk or dual boot, prefer LUKS encryption \
6. After getting to the desktop, run this script in any Terminal:

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-LX/refs/heads/main/script/main.fish" | fish

```
Paste with `Ctrl + Shift + V`
Some errors are expected. Allow inhibiting shortcuts if requested.

Sometimes your user password will be asked. Copy and paste it whenever prompted.
In terminals, usually it is `Ctrl + Shift + C` and `Ctrl + Shift + V` for copy-pasting

You may not like some preferences so ðŸª¨ âž› ðŸ—¿ as you like only after the reboot,
as doing so during the script runs can result in errors ðŸ¤¯

What to do with the drive? Keep it as a backup troubleshooting drive!
You can move ISOs like UBCD Live, HBCD, or even Tails if ykyk
