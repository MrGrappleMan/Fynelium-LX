[Timer]
# The Fedora Project's own docs suggest updating "on an almost daily basis", and this uses experimental/prerelease versions of software

# Method A: - Based on wall-clock
# AccuracySec=4h - allows timers to be auto-rescheduled and coalesced within the NEXT 4 hours to prevent unnecessary CPU wake-ups and energy efficiency
# Persistent=true - tries to run the target if the time to be ran is due
# OnCalendar=00,04,08,12,16,20:00:00 UTC - attempt to run 6 times day, and this can be forced to follow a specific timezone, here UTC
Persistent=true
OnCalendar=00,04,08,12,16,20:00:00 UTC
AccuracySec=4h

# Method B: - Monotomic, based on actual run time of the service
# Ensures the system always has a 4-hour "breather" after the service actually finishes
# It "naturally" staggers updates across devices due to some processing updates fast or slow, the package download speeds per region, etc.
# Fires 4 hours later, relative to the end(when the program quit) time of previous run of the service
# If a service unit never deactivates because it crashes or hangs indefinitely, the OnUnitInactiveSec timer will not restart
# it automatically because the inactive state is never reached. This can definitely cause issues, so OnBootSec can help resolve that by providing a definite time.
# If the service state is lost or it has never run, this guarantees the first run, providing a reference timestamp for OnUnitInactiveSec
#OnBootSec=20min
#OnUnitInactiveSec=4h
#Persistent=true - does not work with monotonic timers
