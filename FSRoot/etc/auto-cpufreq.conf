# In the above, 'or' means what I would choose if the previous option wasn't available. The governor preference is primarily due to them being biases for the system

# Some inaccuracies, but fine

# I will be aliasing auto-cpufreq as "ACP"
# Made in accordance to be cross compatible with TLP, but TLP can no longer be used on Bazzite due to its change in architecture in 1.9
# I bet 2.0 comes with a whole ML based power monitoring solution, though that would surprise me if they did
# ACP behavior relies on its monitoring to pick the best frequencies.

# PState drivers are heavily useful for scaling.

# The 'balanced mode' offered by ACP is fine, the rigidity of only using a biased option like performance or powersave.
# Search results are vague. I don't think it actually changes the governor dynamically at runtime(only considers ac/battery)

# schedutil > interactive > ondemand > Adaptive governors > Static governors (performance/powersave); the usual case for most situations.
# For performance stability, performance may outperform schedutil.
# Here, performance/powersave are biases and not forcing the kernel to bindly stay at the extreme frequencies. 
# Else, they are just hard locks to frequencies when not using pstate drivers or ACP

# When schedutil > performance?
# Higher unnecessary clock speeds increase temps, causing some thermal throttling which is
# counterproductive for actual performance-heavy workloads. Only scale up when required.

# When schedutil > powersave?
# There are factors of race to idle when required which can give some level of long term efficiency

# But they are biases, so ACP and pstate drivers partially work together to mitigate this overall.
